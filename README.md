🚀 AWS Practice Labs Repository

Welcome to my AWS learning and practice repository!
This repository contains hands-on labs, configuration files, troubleshooting notes, and command references for various AWS services that I practice every day.

📌 Objective

To build strong cloud and DevOps skills by practicing AWS services and documenting everything in one place for future reference and interview preparation.

📂 Folder Structure (Planned)

Each AWS service will have a separate folder:

AmazonWebServices/
│
├─ cloudwatch-ec2-logs/
│
├─ ec2-webserver-setup/
│
├─ vpc-three-tier-architecture/
│
├─ s3-hosting-static-website/
│
├─ iam-lab-policies-users/
│
├─ lambda-eventbridge-automation/
│
└─ rds-database-setup/


More labs will be added continuously as I learn.
