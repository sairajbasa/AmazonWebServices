# 🚀 AWS Practice Labs Repository

Welcome to my AWS learning and practice repository!  
This repository contains hands-on labs, configuration files, troubleshooting notes, and command references for various AWS services that I practice every day.

## 📌 Objective
To build strong cloud and DevOps skills by practicing AWS services and documenting everything in one place for future reference and interview preparation.

## 📂 Folder Structure (Planned)
Each AWS service will have a separate folder, for example:

aws-labs/
│
├─ cloudwatch-ec2-logs/
├─ ec2-webserver-setup/
├─ vpc-three-tier-architecture/
├─ s3-hosting-static-website/
├─ iam-lab-policies-users/
├─ lambda-eventbridge-automation/
└─ rds-database-setup/

More labs will be added continuously as I learn.
